# üåø Desktop Plant ‚Äî TODO List

A comprehensive roadmap for developing the Desktop Plant project in Godot 4.4. Includes core goals, upcoming features, and planned enhancements.

---

## ‚úÖ Initial Project Goals (In Progress)

- [x] Create base cactus plant and setup procedural growth prototype.
- [ ] Implement parameterized procedural growth logic.
- [ ] Support for multiple plant species/types.
- [ ] Add branching, flowering, and fruit generation behaviors.
- [ ] User-adjustable plant growth parameters.
- [ ] Add accessories and decorations for plant customization.
- [ ] Implement pruning and editing tools for plant shaping.
- [ ] Integrate multiple shaders for visual styles.
- [ ] Customizable plant pots (vases).
- [ ] Save and load plant states.
- [ ] Remove window background and borders for seamless desktop integration.
- [ ] Design minimalistic UI for user interaction.

## üå± Procedural Growth & Biology

- [ ] **Day/Night Cycle Integration**
  - Simulate time-based lighting.
  - Adjust plant growth speed or visuals depending on day/night.

- [ ] **Plant Mood & Health System**
  - Hydration, pruning quality, and environment response.
  - Influence plant growth behavior and appearance based on "health".

- [ ] **Environmental Effects**
  - Wind animation on leaves/branches.
  - Particles or insect effects for ambiance.

- [ ] **Seasonal Growth**
  - Visual changes and event triggers by season (e.g., autumn leaves, winter dormancy).

- [ ] **Hybrid Plant Breeding**
  - Mix procedural parameters from two parent plants to create unique offspring.

---

## üé® Visual & Style Customization

- [ ] **Shader-Based Visual Styles**
  - Watercolor, pixel art, cel-shaded, etc.
  - Switchable at runtime.

- [ ] **Custom Growth Pattern Drawing**
  - Allow users to guide or sketch desired plant shape.
  - Procedural system adapts to match user input.

---

## üå¨Ô∏è Environment-Based Interactivity

- [ ] **Reactive Plant Behavior**
  - Respond to:
    - Mouse movement.
    - Audio/music input.
    - Desktop activity (e.g., idle mode).

---

## üéÆ Gameplay & Engagement

- [ ] **Mini-Games for Care**
  - Watering, pruning, or harvesting interactions.
  - Reward system that affects growth.

- [ ] **Achievements & Unlockables**
  - Unlock new species, accessories, or pots with progress milestones.

- [ ] **Growth Journaling**
  - Snapshot stages of plant development.
  - Generate time-lapse animation or export to media formats.

---

## üíæ System Features

- [ ] **Cross-Platform Save Sync**
  - Cloud support (Steam Cloud, Dropbox, etc.).

- [ ] **Export to Image or GIF**
  - Capture current state.
  - Export growth animations.

---

## üîß Modding & Architecture

- [ ] **Data-Driven Plant Definitions**
  - External `.json` or `.tres` files to define plant types.
  - Easy for modding and extension.

- [ ] **Plugin/Add-on System**
  - Allow modular loading of species, shaders, or features.
  - Folder-based or GDExtension-based plugin structure.
